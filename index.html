        The tuba (UK: /ˈtjuːbə/;[1] US: /ˈtuːbə/) is the lowest-pitched musical instrument in the brass family. As with all brass instruments, the sound is produced by lip vibration – a buzz – into a mouthpiece. It first appeared in the mid-19th century, making it one of the newer instruments in the modern orchestra and concert band. The tuba largely replaced the ophicleide.[2] Tuba is Latin for "trumpet".[3]A person who plays the tuba is called a tubaist, a tubist,[4] or simply a tuba player. In a British brass band or military band, they are known as bass players.
